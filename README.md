# project-1-repo
Repo for 1st bootcamp project

## Description
The main goal of the week 1 challenge is to demonstrate what has been learned during week 1 of bootcamp.
It will help us showcase our ability for using, creating, and cloning new gihub repos as well as being able to update after editing.

## Purpose
The purpose is to use our knowledge gained from the prework exercises and apply them to a new project that involves using prewritten code to edit and save any changes into our own repository.
- The motivation for this project is to be able to display the ability to follow instructions, implement, and display a working end product.
- This project was created to simulate an on the job experience and deliver a working product for the share holder/employer.
- This project solve issues related to being able to take a starter code and edit into a working product that can be deployed to the customer.
- In this project I learned:
  - How to use pre-written code and add it to my own repository.
  - Utilize the code to edit and deploy a new product that satifies the acceptance criteria.
